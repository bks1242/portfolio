              Women&&Tech was launched in 2012 to feature interviews with
              different women working in the tech industry. I became familiar
              with them when I was invited to be one of the interviewees! A few
              years later, I joined the team and helped with the relaunch of the
              site as the front-end architect.

              inspired to create something just for fun. I realized that of all
              the content/lorem ipsum generators available, there was nothing
              for HBO’s The Wire fans. I searched for

                >thewireipsum.com</a

                Abstract: The main objective of this paper is implementation of
                open circuit voltage MPPT controller for solar PV System based on
                FPGA. MPPT controllers are plays a major role in solar PV system
                due to its advantage like increases efficiency by tracking maximum
                power from the panel under all conditions. Among all other
                existing methods open circuit method is one of the simplest method
                to draw maximum power. In case of fractional voltage type MMPT
                utilizes the concept of solar module voltage at maximum power
                condition is follows the linear relation with open circuit voltage
                under different temperature and insulation conditions. In this
                paper, mathematical modeling of solar module and design of DC-DC
                converter and small signal analysis of charge controller are
                presented.
